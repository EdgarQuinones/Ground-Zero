Ground Zero is an exciting new video game where players survive waves of enemies in a 3D, wave-based game. It features multiple weapons, a shop system, and is designed for those interested in suriving as long as you can, with different playstyles.

## 🎮 Gameplay

The biggest twist of our game that makes it different from the rest is that when you kill enemies, you have the chance to take the body parts of the robots and use them as weapons. For example, for this early build, enemies sometimes drop their laser head, which you can then use yourself to defeat the waves of robots.
